    "  In numpy array method, all tasks are broken into small segments and are then processed parallelly. An array, in addition, occupies less space than a list(since it stores just one kind of datatype). This also contributes to its speed. This can be technically termed as Homogeneous datatypes with contiguous memory, unlike Lists. The NumPy package also integrates C, C++, and Fortran codes in Python, which have very little execution time compared to Python. Considering the operating frequency of a ssingle threaded CPU to be 2GHz, the ideal time of computation for 10k numbers must be around 0.5 ns.\n",

    "  This must stem from the differences in how floating point numerals are handled in C and Python. The internal datatype used in C must be such that it has more precision than its Python counterpart. We know that 64 bit floating points are used in array method."

    "- All the matrices may also contain GND instead of 0. In order to facilitate numeric handling, we replace all the grounds with zeroes\n",
    "- We then create a list x that contains all the nodes, 0 through the last node. This when added with the number of independent voltage sources gives us the size of the vector that we need\n",

    "P.S: Sorry for the late submission. I was sick a few days ago and managed to finish my assignment only by today. Solving the 3rd question from the scratch was extremely challenging and exciting at the same time. I took my time to do justice to the question and tried to do it as accurate as I can. I've neglected cases with multiple AC sources and ones with AC and DC sources combined. We must be able to solve them too by modifying a few lines of code in the above code. I've also assumed that the line right after .end is ac, and that there are no junk lines in between. Thanks!"
